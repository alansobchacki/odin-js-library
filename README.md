Project: Library
=============

A basic app that allows users to add, remove, and edit the read status of their books.

Here's the [live project demo.](https://alansobchacki.github.io/odin-library/)

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Javascript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) curriculum.

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Add a function to the script (not the constructor) that can take the user’s input and store the new book objects into an array.
- [x] Write a function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page. 
- [x] Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read, and anything else you might want.
- [x] Add a button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.
- [x] Add a button on each book’s display to change its read status.

What I Learned
-----

I learned how to build constructors and remove the default behavior of events that weren't explicitly handled (using the preventDefault() method).

Notes
-----
It does NOT save the information between page reloads. This will be handled in a later part of the curriculum.

And it's ugly. I focused on getting the Javascript part first. I will return at a later stage and revamp the UI.
